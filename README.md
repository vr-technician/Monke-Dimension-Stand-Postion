# Monke-Dimension-Stand-Postion
the files to change location of the monke dimesion stand to be right next to the leader board

after compiling you might (not for sure) get this weird UI (doesn't appear if you have the latest version of wryser's gopro) on your screen wich you can see in the file ''UI.png'' above â†‘ 



( compatible with my new position of GorillaShirt Stand ) 




steps to put the stand right next to the leader board :




Step 1 : install the source code of monke dimesions (https://github.com/Chin0303/Monke-Dimensions)




step 2 : install the files that are in the release ( main.cs and TeleportDimension.cs )




step 3 : replace the main.cs file with the new on wich is located at : C:\Users\yourname\Downloads\Monke-Dimensions-master\Monke Dimensions




replace the file TeleportDimension.cs with the new one wich is located at : C:\Users\yourname\Downloads\Monke-Dimensions-master\Monke Dimensions\Behaviours




step 3 : open the code in visual studio and replace every library that has an error



Compile the project and then you are done !!




Steps to put your own location of both respawning when comming back from a dimension and the stand :





Step 1 : install the source code of monke dimesions (https://github.com/Chin0303/Monke-Dimensions)





step 2 (location of the stand) : open the monke dimension source code/project with visual studion then locate the file main.cs in the explorer then go to the line 57 and change the cords to what ever you want ( the rotation is right bellow at the line 58 and only use the rotation numbers of the middle otherwise the stand will no be straight )



tip: you can move the stand with unity explorer and copy the cords to be accurate the first try



steps to put the location of where you spawn back : install the source code of monke dimesions (https://github.com/Chin0303/Monke-Dimensions) then go yo the line 32 and change it to what ever you want !





tip: you can move the stand or any moveable object with unity explorer to locate the cords of wherever you wanna spawn back at




Compile the project and then you are done !!
